# This is a simple build script that builds all MLB files in the current
# directory. Standard ML does not define how to build programs, so we have to do
# it ourselves.
#
# MLton works directly on MLB files, but Poly/ML does not. Therefore, we
# generate a Poly/ML top-level file from the MLB file and compile that instead.
